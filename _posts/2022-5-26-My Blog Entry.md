# Introduction
**It's nearly** summer, so I've decided to write a blog entry making some resolutions, because I want to improve some things in my life before we start school again.

## My Resolutions
I promise I will be more aplied to my life and my work, but I will try to do it in a way that I can be more effective in my work.
When someone asks me to help I will try to help him or her.
As soon as I finish my homework, I will try to make sure that I have done it well, and that I understand what I did.
I should be more concentrated in classes.

## My Resolutions II
This paragraph is more focused about my personal life and my own work.
I'm good at planing proyects and I'm good at doing them, but my main problem is that I have to many proyects open at the same time and I don't have time to do them, so my resolution for the next week is to do them in a way that I can do them in a better way and not expending to much time for nothing. So I don't overflow my time with useless proyects.
I should try to sleep more time and don't spend too much time in the computer.


# Conclusion
I hope that I have done everything that I can do to improve my life and my work!
*Cya!*
